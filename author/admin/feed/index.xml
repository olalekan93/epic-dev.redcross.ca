										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Real Madrid have been doing nothing for the past few years to sign Kylian Mbappe. After various dramas, the PSG star is supposed to go to the Spanish club this season. Bayern Munich defender Alphonso Davies is also rumored to be joining Real Madrid.</p>
<p>Mbappe and Davies have been rumored to be joining Real Madrid, with one supporter pleading with Real president Florentino Perez to bring them into the team soon. What Perez said in response is bound to make anyone laugh.</p>
<p>While taking pictures of Perez with supporters, one said, Davies and Mbappe should be bought. Then we will win everything. In response, Perez pretended not to know them and said, &#8216;Who is Davis? Who is Mbappe?&#8217;</p>
<p>Kylian Mbappé&#8217;s move to Real Madrid is now highly probable. A few days ago, PSG coach Luis Enrique also indicated that. Mbappe was taken off early in the second half in one match and questions were raised about him. Responding to criticism, the Spanish coach said, &#8216;It is now clear, Kylian will not be at Paris Saint-Germain in the future. So we are testing other strategies. We will have to get used to it without him.&#8217;</p>
<p>According to European media reports, Mbappe is joining Real Madrid at the end of this season. Several media outlets have already said that an agreement has been reached between the two parties. Now just waiting for June.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago, Putin again warned about the risk of nuclear war. In his annual address to the nation on Thursday (February 29), he said there would be a &#8216;real&#8217; risk of nuclear war if Western countries escalated tensions over the Ukraine war.</p>
<p>The war in Ukraine marked two years last week. On February 24, 2022, Russia began military operations towards Kiev. Ukraine&#8217;s resistance to fighting that escalated into a bloody conflict. Despite not directly participating in the conflict, the West, the United States and European countries are providing all kinds of support to Volodymyr Zelensky&#8217;s government in Kiev.</p>
<p>However, European leaders have indicated sending troops to Ukraine. Recently, French President Emmanuel Macron said that he is not rejecting sending French troops to Ukraine. After Macron&#8217;s statement, Putin warned about nuclear war. </p>
<p>Newsweek said it has reached out to Russia&#8217;s foreign ministry via email for comment on the talk show&#8217;s remarks. But still no reply.</p>
<p>Many Russian politicians and officials have expressed fears that a &#8216;real&#8217; nuclear war could break out in the wake of the conflict in Ukraine. These include former Russian President and Prime Minister and current National Security Advisor Dmitry Medvedev to Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an interview given to ESPNcricinfo on International Women&#8217;s Day on Friday (March 8), the captain of the Bangladesh women&#8217;s cricket team, Jyoti, highlighted the story of the struggle of women cricketers in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Describing how challenging it is for women in Bangladesh to take up cricket as a career, Jyoti said, &#8216;You know, we live in a Muslim country. Here it is very difficult for a woman to take cricket as a profession. Because our culture is conservative. People here cannot accept it. They think women should stay at home, they should only do housework. This is the culture here.&#8217;</p>
<p>Jyoti also brought up his experience of struggle. Expressed gratitude to parents for providing courage and support during difficult times. According to her, it is the parents who provide the real courage behind women to come out of the house and overcome the social barriers and become successful.</p>
<p>The Tigress captain said, “I come from a very middle-class family and a small town. So it (becoming a cricketer) was very, very difficult for me. Because every time I went to the field, people would say bad things. They used to say, &#8216;Women&#8217;s cricket has no future in Bangladesh. We shouldn&#8217;t go out, don&#8217;t wear jerseys, t-shirts, all that. It&#8217;s not a good culture.&#8217; It was a difficult moment for many women and girls like me. Parents also had a hard time telling their daughters, &#8216;Go ahead. Go and fulfill your dreams and be strong for your dreams&#8217;. I should thank all the parents. They are very brave. They actually support their daughters. If I talk about my parents, it was a brave decision for them. It was very difficult for them to support me at that time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jyoti regretted not only the harsh words of the people of the society, but also that she did not get the support of the people of the country in the beginning. But the atmosphere changed in 2018. When Team Tigress brought the Asia Cup trophy to the country by defeating India.</p>
<p>Jyoti said, &#8216;Initially people were not interested (in women&#8217;s cricket). But after the 2018 Asia Cup, where we beat India to win the title. That was our first major achievement. After that we actually managed to attract all kinds of attention from the people of Bangladesh.&#8217;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Regarding Soumya&#8217;s not out, Mahinda Halangoda said, &#8216;What happened in the match is unfortunate. Now we can&#8217;t get it back. We have sent a report against the umpire. The ICC must monitor the footage. They will take whatever action they need to take.&#8217; </p>
<p>He also said, &#8216;That episode is over for us, we don&#8217;t control the ICC. They may not even ask us about it, but at least review it. What has to be done from our side has been done.&#8217;</p>
<p>Binura Fernando came to bowl in the fourth over of Bangladesh&#8217;s innings. The first ball of this pacer&#8217;s over was back of the length. Soumya Sarkar pulls hard on the over-bouncing ball. But the ball went to wicketkeeper Kushal Mendis. Before that, the Lankans appealed for a cut behind as clear noises were heard. Umpire Gazi Sohel also responded to their call.</p>
<p>Soumya Sarkar took a review immediately when the umpire gave out. The left-hander walked to the dressing room as the review showed a clear spike in Ultra Edge. But when TV umpire Masudur Rahman compared the TV footage captured by Ultra Edge with the camera, he noticed a discrepancy between the spike and the bat-ball position. From one angle, he sees the Ultra Edge spike long after the ball has crossed the bat. Which is never possible. He overruled the on-field umpire&#8217;s decision and called for not out, concluding that the spike was caught not because of the ball hitting the bat but because of something else. Sri Lanka could not accept this. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>European Commission (EC) President Ursula von der Leyen informed on Friday (March 8).</p>
<p>The BBC reported that Ursula von der Leyen announced in Cyprus that the maritime corridor would allow more aid to be sent to Gaza, which is in a humanitarian crisis.</p>
<p>The announcement by the head of the European Commission came less than a day after the US announced the construction of a temporary port on the Gaza coast to send humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>Ursula von der Leyen says,</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday, US President Joe Biden made an official announcement about sending aid to Gaza in his State of the Union address. He said that the US military will build a port on the coast of Gaza to send relief to Gaza by sea.</p>
<p>After the president&#8217;s announcement, US officials said that the relief aid sent to the Palestinians through that port will increase significantly and it will be possible to send these relief items in several hundred trucks every day.</p>
<p>However, the construction of the temporary port will take several weeks to complete, officials said. Large ships can come to this port with food, water, medicines and temporary shelter materials.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Bangalpara of Ashtagram, the people of Howar had to suffer because of the lack of a bridge across the Meghna river connecting the two districts. During the monsoon there was no option of communication except by boat. The government has taken the initiative of constructing a paved bridge over Meghna River in Noagaon of Bangalpara Union and Chatalpara New Market area of ​​Nasirnagar Upazila of Brahmanbaria District to remove the inconvenience of Haor residents. If implemented, the project will usher in new horizons in road connectivity in Howrah. Speed ​​will come in the economy, along with it, the standard of living of Haor people will increase.</p>
<p>According to local residents, Haor is a remote area, so if you want to travel to the district town or Dhaka city, you have to spend one night in a launch or trawler and come back to the village the next day. If the bridge is constructed, the various districts of the country including Brahmanbaria district can be connected by road throughout the year. As a result, I will play a special role in getting the fair price of Haor&#8217;s agricultural products and fresh water fish.</p>
