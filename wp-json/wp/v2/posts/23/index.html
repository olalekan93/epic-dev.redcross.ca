Here it is very difficult for a woman to take cricket as a profession. Because our culture is conservative. People here cannot accept it. They think women should stay at home, they should only do housework. This is the culture here.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>Jyoti also brought up his experience of struggle. Expressed gratitude to parents for providing courage and support during difficult times. According to her, it is the parents who provide the real courage behind women to come out of the house and overcome the social barriers and become successful.<\/p>\n<p>The Tigress captain said, \u201cI come from a very middle-class family and a small town. So it (becoming a cricketer) was very, very difficult for me. Because every time I went to the field, people would say bad things. They used to say, &#8216;Women&#8217;s cricket has no future in Bangladesh. We shouldn&#8217;t go out, don&#8217;t wear jerseys, t-shirts, all that. It&#8217;s not a good culture.&#8217; It was a difficult moment for many women and girls like me. Parents also had a hard time telling their daughters, &#8216;Go ahead. Go and fulfill your dreams and be strong for your dreams&#8217;. I should thank all the parents. They are very brave. They actually support their daughters. If I talk about my parents, it was a brave decision for them. It was very difficult for them to support me at that time.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Also Read: Bangladesh Alone In Mission To Win Series<\/p>\n<p>Jyoti regretted not only the harsh words of the people of the society, but also that she did not get the support of the people of the country in the beginning. But the atmosphere changed in 2018. When Team Tigress brought the Asia Cup trophy to the country by defeating India.<\/p>\n<p>Jyoti said, &#8216;Initially people were not interested (in women&#8217;s cricket). But after the 2018 Asia Cup, where we beat India to win the title. That was our first major achievement. After that we actually managed to attract all kinds of attention from the people of Bangladesh.&#8217;<br \/>\nMORE TIME NEWS<br \/>\nSri Lanka complains to ICC about Soumya&#8217;s not out<br \/>\nthe game<br \/>\n6 minutes ago<br \/>\nSri Lanka complains to ICC about Soumya&#8217;s not out<br \/>\nSri Lanka is worried after losing the second T20I.
