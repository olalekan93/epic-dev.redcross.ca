The first ball of this pacer&#8217;s over was back of the length. Soumya Sarkar pulls hard on the over-bouncing ball. But the ball went to wicketkeeper Kushal Mendis. Before that, the Lankans appealed for a cut behind as clear noises were heard. Umpire Gazi Sohel also responded to their call.<\/p>\n<p>Soumya Sarkar took a review immediately when the umpire gave out. The left-hander walked to the dressing room as the review showed a clear spike in Ultra Edge. But when TV umpire Masudur Rahman compared the TV footage captured by Ultra Edge with the camera, he noticed a discrepancy between the spike and the bat-ball position. From one angle, he sees the Ultra Edge spike long after the ball has crossed the bat. Which is never possible. He overruled the on-field umpire&#8217;s decision and called for not out, concluding that the spike was caught not because of the ball hitting the bat but because of something else. Sri Lanka could not accept this. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Regarding Soumya&#8217;s not out, Mahinda Halangoda said, &#8216;What happened in the match is unfortunate.
